 * Read gamepad. Currently only 3-button pads on port A are read.
 *
 * \return Pad status in format SACBRLDU (START, A, C, B, RIGHT, LEFT,
 *         DOWN, UP). For each bit, a '1' means that the button/direction
 *         is not pressed. A '0' means that the button/direction is pressed.
 *         Masks can be used to filter returned data (see GpMasks).
