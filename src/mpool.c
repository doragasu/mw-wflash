 * \brief Memory Pool.
 *
 * Implements a memory pool for dynamic memory allocation. This memory pool
 * gets memory from the unused region between the end of the .bss section
 * and the stack top. The implementation is pretty simple: an internal
 * pointer grows when memory is requested, and is reset to the specified
 * position to free memory. This restricts the usage of the module to
 * scenarios that free memory in exactly the reverse order in which they
 * requested it (it does not allow generic allocate/free such as malloc()
 * does).

 * \brief Free memory up to the one pointed by pos.
 *
 * Memory previously allocated is freed up to pos position. The usual (and
 * recommended) way of using this function is calling it with pos set to the
 * value of the last MpAlloc() call.
 *
 * \warning This function might free memory requested by several MpAlloc()
 * calls if the input pos pointer is not the last returned by MpAlloc(). E.g.
 * if MpAlloc() is called consecutively three times, and MpFreeTo() is called
 * with the pointer returned by the second call, the memory granted by the
 * second and third calls to MpAlloc() will be deallocated. Although this is
 * usually undesired, sometimes it is useful. In any case it is important
 * taking it into account when using this module.
 *
 * \warning Function fails (and does nothing) if input position is NOT
 * aligned as required by MP_ALIGN parameter. As MpAlloc() always returns
 * aligned pointers, this should not be a problem when using the function as
 * intended (passing pointers obtained by MpAlloc() calls).
